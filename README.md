  - **Biggest Size**: Selects the largest file.
  - **Most Downloaded**: Picks the most downloaded file.
  - **Latest**: Chooses the most recent file.
- Uses **multi-threading** for faster processing.
- Saves links as a linebreak separated list in `links.txt` for use with download managers (e.g. IDM).
- Available as both an **executable file** and an **open-source Python script**.
